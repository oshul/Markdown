# Markdown
__Markdown__ _is_ a lightweight markup *language* **with** *__plain__* text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[8] Markdown is *~~often~~* used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.


1. To create indentation use one of the following:
  - Surround the word(s) with Asterisk (Simillar to whatsapp): *Like this* 
  - Surround the word(s) with a single underscore: _Like this_ 
2. To create a strikthrough (line through the text), surround the word(s) with two tildas at each side: ~~Markup~~

4. To make the text bold:
  - Surround text with two underscores on each side: __like this__
  - Surround text with two Asterisks on each side: **like this** 
  - Surround text with two Asterisks on each side: ##like this
5. To create a bullet point, start the line with a minus sign.
6. To create a title line like the one at the top of this page, start with a hashtag. the number of hastags determines the type:
  # Large title
  ## Medium title
  ### Small title

7. Somethimes you want to present a list of itmes using checkboxes (for example, steps in a project). The line containing the checkbox has to start with a asterisk! Create an unchecked checkbox using square brackets with a space between them .To create a checked checkbox (completed item) put an x between the brackets.
  * [ ] Buy Bread
  * [x] Buy milk
